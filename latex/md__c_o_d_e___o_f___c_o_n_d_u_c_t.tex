In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-\/free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-\/economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\hypertarget{md__c_o_d_e___o_f___c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Our Standards}{Our Standards}}\label{md__c_o_d_e___o_f___c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md1}
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Using welcoming and inclusive language
\item Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
\item Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
\item Showing empathy towards other community members
\end{DoxyItemize}

\item The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
\item Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\hypertarget{md__c_o_d_e___o_f___c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Scope}{Scope}}\label{md__c_o_d_e___o_f___c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md3}
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-\/mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\hypertarget{md__c_o_d_e___o_f___c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Enforcement}{Enforcement}}\label{md__c_o_d_e___o_f___c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md4}
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at \href{mailto:conduct@mlpack.org}{\texttt{ conduct@mlpack.\+org}}. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project\textquotesingle{}s leadership.\hypertarget{md__c_o_d_e___o_f___c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Reporting}{Reporting}}\label{md__c_o_d_e___o_f___c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md5}
If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report it by emailing \href{mailto:conduct@mlpack.org}{\texttt{ conduct@mlpack.\+org}}. All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that\textquotesingle{}s the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.

In your report please include\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
\item Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
\item When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
\item Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.\+g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.
\item Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
\item If you believe this incident is ongoing.
\item Any other information you believe we should have.
